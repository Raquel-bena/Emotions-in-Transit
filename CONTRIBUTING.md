# Contributing to Emotions in Transit

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! This document outlines our guidelines for maintaining the ethical and technical integrity of the installation.

## Core Principles
1. **Privacy First**: Never add features that capture identifiable biometric data without explicit consent
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure all interactions have multiple access points (visual, auditory, tactile)
3. **Transparency**: All data sources and processing must be clearly documented
4. **Sustainability**: Optimize for low power consumption and minimal environmental impact

## Contribution Process
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
5. **Create a Pull Request**

## Ethical Review Required For
- Any new data source integration
- Changes to biometric interaction
- Modifications to the clustering algorithm
- Hardware modifications affecting user safety

## Testing Requirements
All contributions must include:
- Unit tests for new functionality
- Performance benchmarks (FPS, latency)
- Ethical impact assessment
- Documentation updates

## Code Style
- JavaScript: ESLint with Airbnb config
- Python: PEP8 compliance
- Hardware: Clear pin diagrams and safety notes

Remember: This is not just a software project—it's an artwork with social responsibility. Every line of code should reflect the values of care, empathy, and respect for urban dwellers.
